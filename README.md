during 2007-2009 with machine learning". 4th International Conference of the ERCIM (European Research Consortium

Abstract. An attempt to verify the hypothesis of informational efficiency of financial markets, known as “random walk”, 
is undertaken. The main aspects of the hypothesis are described in relation to financial crises. The hypothesis is 
tested on the real data of the Warsaw Stock Exchange during the financial crisis years 2007-2009 by predictive 
modeling based on Machine Learning (ML). In particular, Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) has been used. The results 
have shown that there exists a weak form of efficiency. The use of GMDH has been shown to provide selection of a near 
optimal structure of predictive models that is of crucial importance for testing the informational efficiency. The GMDH 
has been shown capable of automatically inducing the desired model in the absence of expert knowledge. The results 
obtained with the GMDH models are compared with those achieved with the conventional ML methods. The GMDH models have 
been shown to provide a better accuracy of the predictions than a random choice, that allowed us to conclude on the weak 
form of informational efficiency.
